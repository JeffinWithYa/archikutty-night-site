# Production Setup for Archikutty Family Reunion Voice Chat

## ✅ Security Implementation

### 🔒 Ephemeral Tokens (Production Ready)
The application now uses OpenAI's ephemeral tokens for secure production deployment:

- **✅ No API keys exposed to browser** - Main OpenAI API key stays server-side only
- **✅ Temporary session tokens** - Tokens expire automatically after session
- **✅ Pre-configured sessions** - AI instructions and settings baked into tokens
- **✅ Secure WebRTC** - Direct browser-to-OpenAI connection with ephemeral auth

### 📋 Required Environment Variables

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# AWS S3 Configuration (for transcript/audio storage)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
```

### 🚀 Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set all environment variables in your hosting platform
- [ ] Configure S3 bucket with proper permissions
- [ ] Verify OpenAI API key has Realtime API access
- [ ] Test ephemeral token creation works
- [ ] Confirm S3 file uploads work correctly
- [ ] Set up monitoring for API usage and costs

### 📊 Data Storage Structure

```
S3 Bucket:
├── family-tree-chats/          # Text chat transcripts (JSON)
├── family-tree-voice-chats/    # Voice call transcripts (JSON)
└── family-tree-voice-audio/    # Voice call recordings (WebM)
```
